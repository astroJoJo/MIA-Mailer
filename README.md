📬 Sending the Mailer as an Email
Since email clients don’t support external stylesheets or JavaScript, the mailer must be converted to inline CSS before sending. Use tools like:

Premailer – Converts external CSS to inline styles
Zurb Ink – Helps create responsive email templates
Once converted, copy the full inline HTML and paste it into your email service (Gmail, Outlook, Mailchimp, etc.).

🔗 Call-to-Action (CTA)
The primary CTA button directs users to WhatsApp for direct inquiries:
